### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 part 2 was about Blackjack. It was interesting to learn how to make exceptions for all the different types of inputs you could get. I also enjoyed figuring out how to add up the scores based on the different card types. I also enjoyed using functions. What I enjoyed most about this lab was at the end when I was testing it, and couldnâ€™t see why I was getting the answer wrong, until I realized I forgot an Ace card rule for adding up the points. I noticed this because all my answers were 1 point off than what they needed to be. Once I fixed the code and the points given for the aces the lab was correct and complete. 

* Lab 7

    For lab 7 I was absent so I worked on this lab alone. It was like a test to see how much I could remember independently without help. Part 1 of this lab was also a continuation or a more complex version of one of the labs that we completed before which was about the Jullian days. With this lab, we added the use of command line arguments and used those as inputs. For part 2 of this lab, it was fun to use if statements to determine when one could part on certain streets. I enjoyed this lab because it was like a logic puzzle.

* Lab 9

    For lab 9 part 2 we had to compare two philosophers' schedules and make sure they weren't eating at the same time. I enjoyed this lab because it helped me understand better how to compare strings. My understanding of using loops was also solidified because we had to loop through each element of the philosopher's schedules to compare them. This lab was difficult for me at first, but once my professor explained it I had a much better understanding of the concepts.
